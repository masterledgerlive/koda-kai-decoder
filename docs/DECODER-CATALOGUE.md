# Decoder Catalogue (seed — growing on the research loop)

*Every decoder and code cracker, in library form. Grades: VERIFIED / CORROBORATED /
CLAIMED / SPECULATION.*

## Historical codebreakers
- **Napoleon 1809 homophonic cipher (AI-deciphered, Oct 2026):** a homophonic
  cipher letter to General de Marmont, unread for 217 years (~1,300 cipher
  units, 155 symbols), was closed by a multi-modal AI pipeline (image
  transcription → symbol segmentation → simulated annealing) from a single
  scanned image in about six hours — no recovered key. First real case study
  of machine-assisted cryptanalysis on an unsolved historical cipher.
  [CORROBORATED]
- **Enigma** (1918–1945): rotor cipher machine; broken at Bletchley Park with the
  Bombe — the lineage of breaking the "unbreakable." [VERIFIED]
- **Lorenz cipher / Tunny**: broken via Colossus, the first programmable digital
  computer. [VERIFIED]
- **Purple (Japan)**: broken by US Signals Intelligence before WWII. [VERIFIED]
- **JN-25 (Japanese naval operational code, WWII)**: ~45,000 five-digit code
  groups, superenciphered by ~18,000-entry additive tables; broken cumulatively
  by Stations HYPO/CAST/NEGAT — additive reuse and code-clerk mistakes were the
  entry. By April 1942 HYPO read ~10–15% of traffic within hours; that partial
  read plus the "AF = Midway" deception confirmed the Midway target, letting an
  outnumbered US fleet ambush and defeat the Japanese carriers (June 1942).
  Lesson: partial-but-timely reads are decisive, and breaks come from usage
  flaws, not the machine. [CORROBORATED]
- **Classical methods**: frequency analysis, Vigenère breaking (Kasiski/Babbage),
  one-time pads (unbreakable when used correctly). [VERIFIED]

## Crypto decoders
- RSA / discrete-log systems: threatened by **Shor's algorithm** on a large
  fault-tolerant quantum computer. [CORROBORATED]
- **Post-quantum migration**: NIST-standardized PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
  are rolling out now. [VERIFIED]
- AES-256: Grover's algorithm halves effective strength — still considered safe.
  [CORROBORATED]

## Media decoders — the VLC model
VLC/ffmpeg decode nearly every codec on earth: H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1, VP9,
AAC, Opus, FLAC, MP4/MKV containers, subtitle formats. "Decode everything" is a
real, working model — the cost is maintenance against a moving target of new
formats. [VERIFIED]
- **AV2 (AOMedia Video 2, v1.0.0, finalized May 28 2026):** the open
  royalty-free successor to AV1 — new bitstream, not backward compatible with
  AV1 decoders; ~30% better compression at the same quality (prototype-stage
  claim); reference software AVM; VLC 4.0 demonstrated software playback at CES
  2026; no hardware decode in any shipping device yet (software only, ~5x
  heavier than AV1 — claimed; hardware expected 2027–2028 — speculation). Every
  new codec parser is new attack surface; "plays everything" is a moving
  target. [CORROBORATED]

## Protocol & language decoders
- **Wireshark dissectors**: the model for protocol decoding — hundreds of
  protocols, community-extended. [VERIFIED]
- **Machine translation / LLMs**: language decoding at scale; low-resource and
  ancient languages are active decipherment frontiers. [CORROBORATED]
- **Wireshark 4.6.9 dissector update (Oct 2026)**: updated dissection for QUIC,
  LoRaWAN, ZigBee ZCL, SGP.32, OpenFlow and more, plus 19 vulnerability fixes
  across dissectors — every dissector is a hostile-input parser.
  [CORROBORATED]
- **Opener / DECT NR+ open reference stack (Aug 2026)**: Apache 2.0 reference
  implementation (C, Zephyr RTOS) of the non-cellular 5G massive-IoT mesh
  standard — a new wireless decode target goes open. [CORROBORATED]
- **Apollo — foundation LLM for Ancient Greek (Sep 2026)**: first advanced LLM
  purpose-built for a dead language (~600M words of Ancient Greek); fills
  missing passages in fragmentary texts, gap-finding, dating, historical
  context, multiple candidates for scholar review. ~80% on masked-passage
  reconstruction; blind-study experts rated suggestions as-good-as-human 77%
  of the time, better 16-20%. Decoder template: dead-language foundation
  models scale decipherment the way cribs scaled Enigma — statistical
  reconstruction of the probable, never proof of the true. [CORROBORATED]
- **SPMTNet / XiXiaDB — structural-prior Tangut recognition (Oct 2026)**:
  deep learning that reads Tangut characters by their component structure
  (composition + spatial relations), not whole-glyph appearance — the general
  template for hieroglyphs/Mayan/cuneiform-class scripts, and the same order
  the Gauntlet uses on a foreign format: structure first, appearance second.

## The quantum track (honestly scoped)
Quantum advantage is **problem-specific** (factoring, search, simulation,
optimization) — not a universal "decode all information" engine. Active research:
quantum error correction, quantum machine learning, quantum cryptanalysis.
The universal quantum decoder stays [SPECULATION] until proven.
