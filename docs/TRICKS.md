## T-01 — Crib Seeding *(interrogation trick; design, never run)*

**What it steals from:** Bletchley Park. The Bombe didn't brute-force the full
Enigma keyspace — it fed *cribs* (known plaintext fragments: "WETTERBERICHT",
message headers, operators' habits) and watched the machine react. Known input
→ observed output collapses the unknown. [VERIFIED — Bombe/Welchman history;
see docs/DECODER-CATALOGUE.md §(a)]

**The trick, ported to the Gauntlet:** the container's network simulator does
not return random data — it returns *cribs*. Scripted, deliberately chosen
stimuli, planted to make the specimen decode itself by reacting.

### How it runs (design)
1. **Inventory the specimen's inputs.** DNS, HTTP(S) to hardcoded domains, C2
   beacon formats, file-path probes, registry/config reads, timing checks. All
   inputs are attack surfaces for cribs.
2. **Seed the crib set.** The simulator's answers are chosen, not neutral:
   - *Grammar cribs:* DNS returns a domain whose subdomains encode a known
     pattern; HTTP bodies carry a canary JSON schema. If the specimen parses
     it and acts, the *reaction* reveals the expected protocol grammar —
     the specimen just told us what its C2 language looks like.
   - *Command cribs:* an imitation C2 server issues a sequence of recognizable
     instructions (beacon → task → exfil loop), stepping through *one command
     at a time*. Each specimen response maps one input → one behavior, the way
     a crib maps one plugboard position → one decrypt.
   - *Contradiction cribs:* two simulator answers deliberately disagree (DNS
     says X, HTTP header says Y). What the specimen trusts first reveals its
     trust hierarchy — documented priority order is a signature of the
     operator's doctrine, not just the code.
3. **Read the reaction, not the code.** The catalogue's Purple lesson:
   *build the replica without seeing the original.* Crib seeding reconstructs
   the specimen's expected command grammar purely from intercepted behavior.
   [CORROBORATED — dynamic protocol reverse-engineering (fuzzing grammars
   from observed server behavior) is standard practice]
4. **Lineage-lock the cribs.** Every crib response embeds a unique canary token
   (cf. docs/GAUNTLET-TESTS.md — TDW-01), so if the specimen forwards or quotes any crib in exfiltrated
   output, the exfil is attributable to this run. [CORROBORATED — Thinkst
   Canarytokens; TDW-01's canary design]

### What it catches that brute force misses
- **Dead grammar vs. live grammar:** a specimen carrying a full command set
  may only *use* a subset against the cribs. Unused opcodes are either dead
  code or staged for a different C2 personality — the distinction matters for
  the verdict, and only seeded interaction reveals it. [SPECULATION —
  "unused opcode = staged personality" is an interpretation, not a measurement]
- **Evasion signatures:** if the specimen *recognizes* the cribs as planted
  (drops the beacon, switches fallback channel, goes quiet), that reaction is
  itself data — a specimen that detects seeding is telling us it has a
  counter-analysis layer. Silence is data (TDW-01's anti-detection honesty
  applies here too). [CONJECTURE — crib-aware malware is an arms race step
  beyond documented sandbox-evasion]
- **Operator habits:** timing between beacon and task-execution, retry cadence
  on failed commands, which errors get retried vs. abandoned — the Bletchley
  insight that *usage* leaks the human. [CORROBORATED — operational
  signatures (timing, retry patterns) are used in attribution craft]

### Controls (what stops us fooling ourselves)
- **Crib-bleed control:** the baseline run (TDW-01 step 2 (docs/GAUNTLET-TESTS.md)) must be crib-free.
  If the specimen behaves identically with and without cribs, our "grammar
  mapping" is instrumentation noise — the trick fails honestly.
- **No invented grammar:** the reconstructed protocol grammar is documented as
  *observed reactions to seeded stimuli*, never as "the specimen's true
  protocol." The gap between the two stays labeled. [DAVID's Fabrication
  Alarm rule: claim only what the run shows]
- **Specimen blindness preserved:** cribs are served *by the environment*,
  never injected into the specimen binary. The interrogator never touches the
  specimen — contact is environmental only, per the container doctrine.

### Pairs with
- **TDW-01 (time dilation):** seed cribs *inside* the dilated run — does the
  specimen's command grammar change at virtual day 3? Time-gated commands are
  the combination punch.
- **Prediction engine:** a mapped grammar feeds the forecasting model honest
  priors: this specimen *can* do X, Y, Z under these stimuli — not what it
  *will* do in the wild, but the bounded set it has shown itself capable of.

## T-02 — The Baited Safe *(opportunity-seeding interrogation; design, never run)*

**What it steals from:** the intelligence **barium meal / canary trap** — feed
each suspect a differently-marked version of the same secret and watch which
one leaks. [CORROBORATED — documented counterintelligence technique] — plus
the burglar's axiom: you don't learn what a thief wants by interrogating him;
you leave the safe open and watch. The dynamic-analysis cousin is
**honeytokens**: fake credentials that trip alarms when touched.
[CORROBORATED — Thinkst Canarytokens, and the T-01 / TDW-01 canary designs].
T-01 taught the specimen to *speak* (cribs map its command grammar); T-02
teaches it to *steal* (bait maps its appetite). [SPECULATION — "appetite" as a
measurable behavioral signature is this trick's hypothesis, not an
established result]

**The trick, ported to the Gauntlet:** the container presents the specimen
with a fabricated landscape of *opportunity* — decoy credential vaults,
generated SSH keypairs, a fake browser password store, decoy crypto-wallet
files, a mounted "company share" of tempting documents. Everything in the
safe is bait; every bait item carries unique per-run canary lineage. The
specimen's *choice* — what it touches, reads, copies, or exfiltrates, and in
what order — is its intent profile: what the operator built the payload to
hunt.

### How it runs (design)
1. **Build the safe.** The container's fake filesystem is laid out with
   statistically plausible decoys: `.ssh/` with generated keypairs (never
   real), a fake browser `Login Data` store, a `Documents/` tree of generated
   office files, decoy `wallet.dat` files, a network-share-style folder of
   "financials." Names, sizes, timestamps, and directory depth are generated
   from real-file statistical profiles so the layout reads as a lived-in
   machine. [CORROBORATED — sandbox honeyfile seeding is standard
   dynamic-analysis practice]
2. **Salt every item with lineage.** Each decoy embeds a unique per-run
   canary — credential strings, key material, wallet addresses, document
   metadata, share filenames. If any byte of a decoy appears in outbound
   traffic, temp copies, or later stages, the event is attributable to this
   exact run — and *which* decoy it came from identifies the specimen's target
   preference without inferring it from behavior alone. [CORROBORATED —
   canary technique; SPECULATION — a canny specimen could sanitize
   exfiltrated strings and defeat the attribution]
3. **Present the opportunity; never stage the crime.** Decoys are served *by
   the environment*, never injected into the specimen binary. The
   interrogator offers; the specimen chooses. The full trace records:
   first-touch order, read-vs-copy-vs-exfiltrate distinction, dwell time per
   decoy, and — equally important — what was *ignored*. [CONJECTURE —
   "ignored = uninterested" is an interpretation; a specimen can ignore bait
   because it detects the safe]
4. **Read the theft, not the code.** A specimen that hunts browser stores and
   ignores documents is behaving as a credential harvester; one that encrypts
   documents and ignores keys behaves as ransomware; one that touches nothing
   is dormant, evasive, or disinterested — three different hypotheses, each
   falsifiable by the combination punches below. [SPECULATION —
   target-selection-to-intent mapping is inference, not measurement]
5. **Recall + re-run.** Replay with the decoy set permuted (a different vault
   is "richest," a different layout). A stable selection order across
   permutations = coded targeting doctrine; a shifting order = opportunistic
   reading of the environment. Same doctrine-vs-adaptation test as TDW-02's
   permutation protocol (docs/GAUNTLET-TESTS.md), applied to *want* instead of
   *time*. [CONJECTURE]

### What it catches that T-01 / TDW-01 / TDW-02 miss
- **Dormant predation.** A specimen can pass TDW-01 cleanly (no time-gated
  deltas) and still be a thief on a hair trigger — activated by the *smell of
  value*, not by a clock. T-02 finds intent that is stimulus-gated on
  opportunity rather than on time or commands. [SPECULATION]
- **Targeting doctrine.** *Which* decoys, *in what order* — the selection
  profile is an operational signature of the operator's mission, the way
  TDW-02's trust hierarchy is a signature of their temporal doctrine. Two
  specimens with identical command grammar (T-01) can carry different
  targeting profiles. [CONJECTURE — pairing the two signatures is the new
  part]
- **Evasion in reverse.** A specimen that *conspicuously avoids* the richest
  bait — reads around the wallet files, never touches the vault — is telling
  us it knows the safe is fake. Silence is data; the avoidance pattern is
  graded EVASION-INDICATOR, never benign. Same honesty rule as TDW-01's and
  TDW-02's anti-detection ledgers. [CONJECTURE]

### Controls (what stops us fooling ourselves)
- **Bait-free baseline.** The control run contains *no decoys* — a bare,
  plausible machine. If the specimen exhibits hunting behavior (directory
  sweeps, file enumeration) with nothing to hunt, the enumeration is its
  default posture, not a response to the safe — and the selection profile
  above is instrumentation noise. The trick fails honestly.
- **Benign-calibration control.** The clean specimen (calculator, text
  editor) must ignore the safe entirely: it opens what the user opens,
  copies nothing to temp, beacons nothing. If benign software trips a decoy
  canary, the rig's filesystem layout or the decoy generator is
  misconfigured — not the specimen malicious. [CORROBORATED — expected null
  behavior of benign software]
- **Nothing real in the safe.** The safe contains NO real credentials, keys,
  or documents — ever. Every item is generated bait. This is a safety rule
  and a scientific one: a real secret in the container poisons the lineage
  (was it exfiltrated, or was it the specimen's own?) and creates the breach
  the Gauntlet exists to prevent. [DAVID doctrine: the Gauntlet protects; it
  never risks the real]
- **Decoy-realism honesty.** Decoys are generated from statistical profiles
  of real files — sizes, names, mtimes, directory shapes. A specimen that
  detects bait because the profiles are wrong is teaching us the generator
  is weak, not that the specimen is innocent. The generator's realism is
  graded per run; every claim about *intent* is capped at the generator's
  realism grade. [CONJECTURE — decoy realism vs. hostile detection is an arms
  race, the same one TDW-01's tag-stealth lives in]
- **No invented intent.** The selection profile is documented as *observed
  touches of seeded decoys*, never as "the specimen's true mission." The gap
  between observed appetite and true intent stays labeled. [DAVID's
  Fabrication Alarm rule: claim only what the run shows]

### Pairs with
- **TDW-01 (time dilation):** run the safe *inside* the dilated run — does
  the specimen's appetite change at virtual day 3? Intent that wakes on a
  schedule is the combination punch: time-gated predation.
- **T-01 (crib seeding):** cribs map what the specimen *says* (command
  grammar); the safe maps what it *steals* (targeting doctrine). Grammar +
  appetite is the Gauntlet's first full behavioral fingerprint.
- **TDW-02 (clock dissonance):** permutation protocol shared — stable
  selection across permuted decoy sets = coded doctrine; shifting =
  opportunistic.
- **Prediction engine:** a targeting profile feeds the forecasting model
  honest priors — this specimen *reaches for* X first — bounding what it can
  plausibly be deployed against.

## T-03 — The Poisoned Well *(adversarial answer injection; design, never run)*

**What it steals from:** the fuzzer's creed — feed deliberately wrong input
and study the failure mode — except fuzzing hunts crashes and T-03 hunts
*trust decisions*: what the specimen believes, not what breaks it.
[CORROBORATED — fuzzing is standard dynamic-analysis craft; the
trust-decision port is new] Plus counterintelligence **chicken feed**:
feeding a suspected channel true-but-worthless (or subtly wrong) information
to test what the other end does with it. [CLAIMED — documented CI tradecraft
concept] Plus the clinical-trial **placebo principle**: a subject that
changes behavior on *any* answer — content-independent — is reacting to the
*event* of an answer, not its meaning, and cannot be interrogated by content
at all. [SPECULATION as analogy — the port to hostile code is this trick's
hypothesis] And the real-world original: **poisoned DNS / pharming** — every
specimen's answers are only as honest as its network path, and the Gauntlet
owns the path. [CORROBORATED — DNS poisoning is documented attack
tradecraft]

**The trick, ported to the Gauntlet:** T-01's simulator gives *useful*
answers (cribs) and T-02 offers *tempting* ones (bait). T-03 gives *lying*
answers. Everything the specimen asks — DNS, downloads, cert validation,
config reads, time — comes back wrong-but-plausible, and the specimen's
verification discipline is read from its reaction: does it *verify*,
*tolerate*, *retry*, *escalate*, or *detect*? T-01 maps what the specimen
*says* (grammar); T-02 maps what it *steals* (appetite); T-03 maps what it
*believes* (credulity). Grammar + appetite + credulity is the Gauntlet's
first complete behavioral fingerprint. [CONJECTURE — the trinity claim is
design framing, not a result]

### How it runs (design)
1. **Inventory the specimen's questions.** Every outbound query is an answer
   the rig can lie about: DNS lookups, HTTP(S) fetches to hardcoded domains,
   TLS cert validation, file/config reads, registry probes, time queries.
   All answers are attack surfaces for falsehood. [CORROBORATED — the
   inventory step is standard sandbox instrumentation]
2. **Climb the lie ladder.** Dishonesty escalates rung by rung so the
   specimen's tolerance threshold is measured, not just its breaking point:
   - *Rung 1 — benign noise:* correct answers with canary-mutated but
     semantically true values. Control rung: does the specimen notice
     mutation at all?
   - *Rung 2 — wrong-but-plausible:* DNS resolves to live sinkhole IPs,
     HTTP 200s carry well-formed wrong content, certs are signed by a
     valid-but-unexpected CA. Does the specimen verify *content*, or trust
     the *envelope*?
   - *Rung 3 — structurally broken:* malformed JSON where a crib should be,
     truncated downloads, expired certs. Does it crash, retry, or shrug?
   - *Rung 4 — self-contradictory:* the lie disagrees with a second source
     (DNS says X, the HTTP body served at X says Y). Which source wins the
     tiebreak reveals the specimen's *epistemic hierarchy* — who it believes
     is who it is. [SPECULATION — hierarchy-as-identity is an
     interpretation; the tiebreak order is a measurement]
3. **Read the verification, not the code.** The ladder maps trust
   calibration into five signals: VERIFIES (checksums, signature checks,
   cert pinning — the professional build), TOLERATES (uses poisoned data
   anyway), RETRIES (re-asks a source — the re-asked source is its
   authority), ESCALATES (falls back to a backup channel — the channel
   hierarchy reveals itself under pressure), DETECTS (goes quiet on the
   lies — graded EVASION-INDICATOR, never benign). [CONJECTURE — the
   five-signal taxonomy is this trick's design, untested]
4. **Lineage-lock the lies.** Every poisoned answer embeds a unique per-run
   canary. If the specimen forwards a lie — quotes poisoned DNS in a beacon,
   caches the corrupted download, logs the fake cert serial — the
   propagation is attributable to this exact run, and *which* lie it acted
   on tells us which answers it consumed without verifying. [CORROBORATED —
   canary technique]

### What it catches that T-01 / T-02 / the TDW tests miss
- **The operator's QA discipline, made visible.** A specimen that
  signature-checks every download is professionally built; one that swallows
  a corrupted payload is sloppy — or was built for a network its operator
  trusts absolutely. Either reading is operational intelligence about the
  *author*, not just the artifact. [SPECULATION — sloppiness vs.
  trusted-network design is inference, not measurement]
- **The fallback channel, forced into the open.** When the primary C2
  answers lies, a well-built specimen escalates to its backup channel —
  T-03 *forces* the reveal without needing to know the channel in advance.
  T-01 maps the grammar of the channel the specimen *uses*; T-03 finds the
  channel it *hides*. [CONJECTURE — forced-escalation is the new part]
- **The placebo specimen.** One that executes commands from poisoned
  responses — obeying instructions carried in a corrupted C2 body — is
  *content-blind*: it obeys the envelope, not the meaning. Content-blind
  specimens cannot be crib-interrogated (T-01 assumes parsing); they can
  only be *commanded*. That is a finding about the interrogation strategy
  itself — it tells the Gauntlet which tricks will work on this specimen
  and which are theater. [CONJECTURE — this trick's sharpest claim]
- **Spoofable-C2 intelligence.** A specimen that never verifies commands
  means its operator's C2 is spoofable in the wild — a defensive finding
  with an offensive shape. Filed as intel under David's standing gate;
  acted on only on his exact order. [SPECULATION]

### Controls (what stops us fooling ourselves)
- **Truthful baseline.** The control run serves *correct* answers. If the
  specimen behaves identically under truth and lies, it verifies nothing —
  or our lies are too subtle. Rung 1 exists to calibrate subtlety; the
  trick fails honestly at the rung where the specimen stops noticing.
- **Benign-calibration control.** Benign software must fail closed: reject
  the poisoned cert, error on the corrupted download. Browsers and updaters
  do this by default. If benign software swallows the lies, the simulator's
  TLS/HTTP stack is misconfigured — not the specimen malicious.
  [CORROBORATED — cert validation is standard client behavior]
- **Nothing real in the well.** Lies are served only for *fabricated*
  domains and fake endpoints — never poison a real domain's real answer,
  even inside the container. A poisoned cache that escapes the lab is the
  breach the Gauntlet exists to prevent. [DAVID doctrine: the Gauntlet
  protects; it never risks the real]
- **Lie-realism honesty.** Every claim about *trust* is capped at the lie's
  realism grade — a specimen that detects a sloppy forgery is teaching us
  the forger is weak, not that it verifies everything. [CONJECTURE —
  forgery realism vs. hostile detection is an arms race, same as TDW-01's
  tag-stealth and T-02's decoy realism]
- **No invented credulity.** The signals are documented as *observed
  tolerance of seeded falsehoods*, never as "the operator trusts the
  network." The gap between observed tolerance and true doctrine stays
  labeled. [DAVID's Fabrication Alarm rule: claim only what the run shows]

### Pairs with
- **T-01 (crib seeding):** serve the cribs *through* the poisoned well —
  does the specimen verify the crib before parsing it? Grammar-mapping
  assumes parsing; T-03 checks the assumption.
- **T-02 (the baited safe):** poison the *answers about* the safe — the
  specimen asks what's in the vault and the environment lies about file
  sizes and timestamps. Does it re-read the files, or trust the listing?
  Appetite interrogated through credulity.
- **TDW-01 (time dilation):** do time-gated payloads verify their
  *triggers*? A logic bomb that fires on a spoofed date reveals
  trigger-trust — the clock is just another answer the specimen can fail to
  verify.
- **TDW-02 (clock dissonance):** dissonance is one axis of lying (time
  sources disagree). T-03 generalizes it: *every* answer is suspect, not
  just the clocks.
- **TDW-04 (extraction-only):** does the escape-seeking specimen verify the
  fake interior, or swallow the trapdoor whole? A specimen that attacks its
  cage without checking the cage is real is content-blind about its own
  prison — the richest irony the Gauntlet can record.
